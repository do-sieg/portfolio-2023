We see now and then recruiters coming on _LinkedIn_ and _Twitter_ to complain **how hard their job is**.

And it often ends up with **applicants** joining the discussion, which then boils down to this:

> **Recruiter**: Life is too hard.  
> **Applicant**: At least you have a job.

Or:

> **Recruiter**: An applicant ignored me today.  
> **Applicants**: Still waiting for you to answer our emails.

After talking with applicants AND recruiters, I was able to put together **five major problems** in the hiring process, that **just make the whole thing ridiculous**.

Here we go...


## 1. Read our resumes for goodness sake!

Months ago, I was contacted for a job. The recruiter **missed the phone appointment** and when they finally called me, I was with my six-months pregnant wife at the supermarket.

So I left my wife in the middle of our shopping and I went **to my car in the parking lot** to deal with this phone interview without the surrounding noise.

(Obviously, I was young and naive. Today, I would have ignored that call.)

So, after 15-20 minutes, this happens:

> **Recruiter**: But you only have X years of experience...  
> **Me**: Yes...  
> **Recruiter**: But our client needs Y years...  
> **Me**: \*sigh\*

Dear recruiter, when **you're** the one who asks for an interview, wouldn't it be a time saver for both of us **to read our resume first**?!

We won't do your job. We **can't** do your job. **We don't know what your client needs**.

By the way...


## 2. Failing to provide the requested information

When you ask about salary, and the recruiter does **everything to dodge** the question...

- Either they **ignore** the information, in which case they have no answer to your most important questions, and the conversation will go no further.

- Either they are **deliberately hiding it** from you, which means **something stinks**. The conversation will go no further.

- Either they believe **it's not right to think about money**. They're still **stuck in the 16th century**, and the conversation will go no further.

Dear recruiters, when you are already working (in a company or as freelance), time is **precious**.

No professional is going to put their assignments on hold to have a call **without knowing where they are going**...

You're not the only ones contacting us in a day: either your offer is **really interesting**, or the job **pays better than the one we already have**.

It's as simple as that.


## 3. No, Java and JavaScript are not the same...

It's not so much your fault. The name _JavaScript_ is a great **scam**.

In fact, they are two languages at the opposite ends of the spectrum.  
There are more similarities between **tennis and table tennis** than between Java and JavaScript.

Now that you know, don't try to convince an engineer to apply anyway, **especially when they've explained already**!

Would you ask **Nadal** or **Federer** to participate in a **table tennis** championship? No.

You're dealing with tech people. Be sure you know what you're talking about or the applicant **won't take you seriously**.


## 4. Automated messages

No, my name is not "**Josh**", and I'm not **senior in PHP development**.

And no, I am not going to "_call you ASAP_". I'm not at your command, and **my time is no less valuable than yours**.


## 5. _Ghosting_ people

**_Ghosting_** is when you ignore people's emails, messages, etc. I've been guilty of it, we all have.

I understand that, as a recruiter, you don't have time to respond to **all applications**, especially when applicants are the ones contacting you.

But when **YOU** are the one messaging people, and they put together files, go through interviewing, etc., and then you decide to **play dead**... please **don't come crying that nobody likes you**.

Same thing when you **promise to "_call back Monday_"**. Just say you'll call us back in a vague way, we know the deal. It's simple: **just don't give a date**.

Because people sometimes put things off to wait for your call, especially when they **really want that job**.

You work in **_human resources_**. You work with **humans**.


## A final word

This article targets **bad recruiters**.

We tend to blame **everything** on **every** recruiter. And it's a little too easy to throw everyone in the same box.

If you don't do these five things, **I love you** (I really do). But if you do... **change**! Or just **change your job**.

Because you're actually making life difficult for a lot of people:
- **Job seekers** who have enough problems already.
- People who have a job and **waste time for nothing** because of you.
- **Honest** companies who **trust** you to find someone.
- **Real recruiters**, who are trying to do their job.

And there are good recruiters out there. Lots of them.
- Recruiters who **call the following week** even if the answer is negative.
- Recruiters who have taken the time to **study your profile**.
- Recruiters who **have done their homework** to **understand the skills they'll have to look**.

And to those, I say **kudos**, and **thanks**.
